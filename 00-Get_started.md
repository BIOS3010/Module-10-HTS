## Logging on to the server
For this part of the course we will be using a common server with a Linux operating system.
A 'server' is a computer that is located elsewhere, and that you can access remotely over the internet.
Servers are often more powerful, and/or have more memory and storage space than desktop or laptop computers.
Using such Linux servers is thus common in bioinformatics.

### Step 1: logging on to login.uio.no

For security reasons, we cannot log into the the server directly. First, we need to log in to another server called `login.uio.no`.
We used this server earlier in the course.
From `login.uio.no`, we can log in to the server for analyses we will do this week and the coming weeks.

Depending on your operating system there are different ways to log on to the `login.uio.no` server.

**Mac/Linux**  
If you have a Mac or a Linux PC, these already run on a Linux-like Operating System and you can open a program called the **Terminal**. The Terminal gives you access to all Linux commands.

When you have that program open, type

```
ssh username@login.uio.no
```

Replace *username* with your UiO username and hit Enter. Type in your UiO password (NB: you will not see anything happen when you type. This is normal).

You should see a message `Welcome to login.uio.no!`

Next, see below under "Logging on to the course server".

**Windows**  
On windows we recommend that you install [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/). This gives you a terminal with unix-style commands available on your local machine. You can then log on to the `login.uio.no` server with the same commands as above.  

You should see a message `Welcome to login.uio.no!`

## Logging on to the analysis server

Once you are logged in to `login.uio.no`, you can log in to the analysis server:

* **odd-numbered groups (1, 3, 5, ...)** do this: `ssh username@itf-appn-test01.hpc.uio.no`
* **even-numbered groups (2, 4, 6, ...)** do this `ssh username@itf-appn-test02.hpc.uio.no`

You may get a message like this:

```
The authenticity of host ... can't be established.
...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```
Type 'yes' and press enter.

Again, write your password when asked for it.

When you have logged on to the server, type the command `pwd`. You should see something like this

## Installing and using software on a Linux system
Installing software on a Linux server like the ones we are using in this class can sometimes be difficult. Many programs have "dependencies", other programs or libraries, that needs to be installed in a specific way in order for the program to run properly. On the servers that we are using in this course there are many programs that have been pre-installed.

* The command `module avail` will give you a list of all pre-installed software. This list is very long. If only the first few are listed (you do not see the prompt (`$`) at the bottom):
  * to browse through, use the spacebar
  * to go back to the terminal prompt, press the `q` key
* To activate a specific program, run `module load software_name/version`

For the rest of the HTS module, we will use `fastqc` and `trimmomatic`. Here, we will only test that you can load the corresponding modules and test the progam.

For `fastqc`, run:

```
module load FastQC/0.11.9-Java-11
fastqc --version
```

You should see this as output:
```
FastQC v0.11.9
```

Now we do the same for Trimmomatic: use `module avail trimmomatic` to figure out the installed version(s). If there is more than one, use the latest version.
Load the module and *read the instructions on how to use the program carefully!* Find out which version we are using by running trimmomatic with `-version` as only parameter.
